# Weather-App

#This app was designed in React. It was intended to be a preview of what a web app strictly for mobile devices would be. Currently, the devices that are supported are ios, and some android devices.
#There are trouble shooting issues which need to be fixed, regarding view ports in browsers on desktop's and some mobile devices. 
#Regardless, the app is fully functioning. Will display current weather, and weather conditions as well as provides a 12 hour forecast.
#The app will be later updated to support further view ports, as well cast a wider range of weather reportings.
